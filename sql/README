Open Staged Development Support for 3.3.5

Copyright (C) OSD Project (http://openstage.board-directory.com/)

OSD Database is a World of Warcraft game databse. It is derived
from many sources.

For further information on the OSD project, please visit our
project website at http://openstage.board-directory.com/.

SQL files to create the database can be found in the Base directory. Files
to update your database from an older revision/version can be found in the
updates directory.

Use our installer to install on windows.
A linux installer is in the works.

Special thanks to these other fine projects.
Without them there would be no OSD Project .
